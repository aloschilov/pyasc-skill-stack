# Height and unroll for strided SwiGLU row copies

Use this geometry for the existing public 950PR SwiGLU 2D kernel. It reads
two half-rows with strided copies and writes one half-row. The short-half
gather and long flat-chunk routes have different DMA and UB costs.

For a logical half of H contiguous elements of s bytes, use H*s for the
useful payload of each row in one input descriptor. Set the physical
width W to H rounded up to a multiple of 32/s elements. Size the tile
from the useful payload and check local allocation using W including
padding. The copy's real shape still uses H.

- Start with the smallest power-of-two height T giving at least 8 KiB of
  useful half-tile payload. A whole row is the minimum. This gives less
  than 16 KiB when a row is smaller than 8 KiB. Halve T until it fits the
  row count and the single-iteration UB budget. If a single row exceeds
  the budget, report that the row kernel cannot fit. A column-chunk
  fallback needs its own UB-qualified chunk size.
- Widen the two FP16 inputs to FP32. Compute the denominator from the
  gate and divide the gate directly by it, then multiply by the value and
  cast once to the output dtype. This saves the extra live FP32 tile in
  the reciprocal-then-multiply expression. Check the full output with the
  task's tolerance since the rounding order changes.
- Size UB from the emitted expression, dtype and compiler configuration.
  On the archive-bundled 950PR public build with `reuse_alloc=2`, the
  direct-division FP16 row kernel used **20 bytes per physical lane** at
  unroll 2 (163,840 bytes for 8,192 lanes). The reciprocal form used 24.
  Use the qualified direct-division coefficient for FP16 and retain the
  conservative 16 bytes/lane at unroll 1. Distinguish FP16 from BF16 in
  the host selector. Keep the existing upper bounds of 28 bytes/lane
  for FP32 and 32 for BF16 at unroll 2 until their emitted forms have
  been qualified. Subtract fixed workspace from the available UB once.
  Verify the compiled allocation on each new kernel/build before
  reusing a smaller coefficient for dispatch.
- At that height select unroll 2 if its footprint fits and ceil(rows/T)
  supplies at least two tiles per active AIV on average. Otherwise keep
  the height at unroll 1. Launch min(available AIVs, ceil(rows/T)) blocks.
  The grid-stride loop owns the final partial tile.

Exercise the selector with a smaller UB that fits only one iteration, a
smaller UB that forces a shorter height, and short grids. Compare warmed
task times and the full golden on the target.
